      "[TextBlock(text=\"Enhanced Query:\\nBlack short-sleeve button-down shirt with tonal floral jacquard pattern, similar to Tommy Bahama style, casual resort wear with tropical print\\n\\nProduct Description:\\nLooking for a sophisticated black short-sleeve button-down shirt featuring a subtle tonal floral jacquard pattern. The shirt should have a classic collar, straight hem, and full-button front closure with light-colored buttons. The fabric should display an elegant embossed or woven tropical floral design creating a textured effect throughout. Ideal material would be silk, rayon, or a similar lightweight fabric with a slight sheen that drapes well. The pattern should incorporate flowing botanical motifs including leaves and flowers in a tone-on-tone design. The style is reminiscent of high-end resort wear, perfect for both casual and semi-formal occasions. The shirt should have a comfortable, relaxed fit typical of tropical-inspired fashion.\\n\\nNote: While the reference image shows a brown shirt, I've adjusted the description for a black version as per your request while maintaining the same style elements.\", type='text')]\n"
